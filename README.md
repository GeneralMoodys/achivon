## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Laravel Sponsors

We would like to extend our thanks to the following sponsors for funding Laravel development. If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, please visit the [Laravel Partners program](https://partners.laravel.com).

# Laravel Livewire Project

## Project Description

This project is a web application built with Laravel, leveraging [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) to create dynamic and responsive UI components. Livewire allows for more interactive applications without the need for excessive JavaScript.

## Features

- **Dynamic Components**: Utilize Livewire to build reactive and interactive UI components.
- **Laravel Integration**: Benefit from all of Laravel's features such as Eloquent, Middleware, and Routing.
- **Less JavaScript**: Reduce the dependency on JavaScript by using Livewire for frontend logic.
- **Real-time Validation**: Validate user inputs in real-time using Livewire.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- PHP >= 8.1
- Composer
- Node.js & NPM
- Laravel >= 9.x
- Livewire >= 2.x

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
    cd repository-name
    ```

2. **Install PHP and Node.js dependencies**

    ```bash
    composer install
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

3. **Configure `.env` file**

    Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and adjust configurations such as database, mail, etc.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

4. **Run database migrations**

    Run the migrations to create the necessary tables in your database.

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

5. **Change .env**

    Update your .env database :

    ```bash
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=laravel
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=
    ```

    The application will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

6. **Start the server**

    You can start a local development server with the following command:

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

    The application will be running at `http://localhost:8000/login`.

## Usage

After installation, you can start developing features using Livewire. A basic example component is available in the `app/Http/Livewire` directory.

To create a new Livewire component, use the command:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire ComponentName
